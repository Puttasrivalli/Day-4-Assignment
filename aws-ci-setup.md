Steps to Set Up a CI Pipeline Using Jenkins on AWS
Provision AWS Infrastructure:

EC2 Instance: Launch an EC2 instance to host Jenkins. Choose an appropriate instance type based on the expected load.
Security Group: Configure the security group to allow HTTP and HTTPS traffic on required ports (typically 8080 for Jenkins).
Install Jenkins on EC2:

Update Packages: Ensure that all packages on the EC2 instance are up to date.
Install Java: Jenkins requires Java to run. Install either OpenJDK or the Oracle JDK.
Add Jenkins Repository: Add the repository to the package manager and import the Jenkins key.
Install Jenkins: Use the package manager to install Jenkins.
Start Jenkins Service: Enable and start the Jenkins service.
Configure Jenkins:

Initial Setup: Access Jenkins via the public IP address of the EC2 instance. Follow the setup wizard to unlock Jenkins using the generated password.
Install Plugins: Install recommended plugins and any additional plugins required for your CI pipeline (e.g., AWS, GitHub, Maven).
Configure Jenkins User and Permissions:

Create Admin User: Set up an admin user and configure security settings.
Configure Global Security: Enable necessary security settings to protect Jenkins.
Set Up Source Control Integration:

Install Git: Ensure Git is installed on the EC2 instance.
Configure Repository: Integrate Jenkins with your GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket repository by creating appropriate credentials and linking Jenkins to the repository.
Create a New Jenkins Pipeline:

New Item: In Jenkins, create a new pipeline job by selecting "New Item" and choosing "Pipeline".
Pipeline Script from SCM: Choose the source control management option and link to the appropriate repository and branch (e.g., feature-aws-ci).
Define Pipeline Stages:

Build Stage:

Configure Jenkins to pull the latest code from the repository.
Set up the build environment with necessary dependencies (e.g., build tools, SDKs).
Define build steps to compile and package the application.
Test Stage:

Set up the test environment, including necessary testing frameworks.
Configure Jenkins to run automated tests (unit tests, integration tests).
Include steps to generate test reports and display them in Jenkins.
Deploy Stage:

AWS CLI: Install and configure the AWS CLI on the Jenkins instance.
IAM Role/Access Keys: Ensure Jenkins has the necessary permissions to deploy to AWS, either through IAM roles or access keys.
Deployment Script: Define and configure deployment scripts (e.g., using AWS CLI or a CI/CD tool) to deploy the application to an EC2 instance.
Configure Build Triggers:

Webhook: Set up a webhook in your repository to trigger Jenkins builds on code changes.
Polling: Alternatively, configure Jenkins to periodically poll the repository for changes.
Commit Pipeline Definition:

Ensure the pipeline definition is part of the repository (e.g., Jenkinsfile) and commit the changes with an appropriate message.
Run and Monitor Builds:

Initial Build: Run the pipeline manually for the first time to ensure everything is configured correctly.
Monitor Builds: Monitor build results and logs in Jenkins. Address any issues that arise during the build, test, or deploy stages.
By following these steps, you will set up a robust CI pipeline using Jenkins on AWS, which will automate the integration and deployment processes, ensuring code quality and rapid delivery.
